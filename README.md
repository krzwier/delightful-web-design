# delightful-web-design

Static website for a freelance web design business, "Delightful Web Design".  This was one of my early forays into HTML and CSS, so the site is not responsive and contains no Javascript.  Designed from scratch.  Images reworked in Adobe Photoshop, and color palette chosen using Adobe Color.
